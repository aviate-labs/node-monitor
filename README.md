# Node Monitor by Aviate Labs

Node monitoring software for (near) immediate notifications of changes to Internet Computer Nodes.

Queries the API every 5 minutes and reports changes to email.
Can be configured to filter different kinds of events.


### Running
Create a .env file in this directory like so
```text
gmailUsername   = "email.sender@gmail.com"
gmailPassword   = "mypassword"
discordBotToken = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
emailRecipient  = "email.receiver@gmail.com"
nodeProviderId  = "abc2d-48fgj-32ab3-2a..."

```

Run with python, and stop with keyboardinterrupt (crtl-c)
```sh
> python3 node_monitor.py
[2022-10-08 07:52:37.210304]: Starting Node Monitor...
