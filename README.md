# Node Monitor

Node monitoring software for notifications of changes to Internet Computer Nodes.
Queries the API with a specified interval and reports changes to email and other various communication channels.

## Setup

Place a `.env` file in this directory.  
Use `.env.example` as a template.

You will also need a file `tmp_prod_db.json` in this directory.  
This is our temporary database until we implement SQLite.


Install dependencies
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Docker

Docker is the recommended way to run this:
```bash
$ docker compose up --build
```

Test only:
```bash
$ TEST=true docker compose up --build
```

## Testing

We use mypy and pytest to do testing and type checking.

```bash
$ make check
$ make test
# To run the test with a live email
# -s flag is to show print statements
$ pytest -s --send_emails tests/
```


## Running

We use Gunicorn as our WSGI server.

```bash
$ make prod
```


## Notes

#### Usage with rsync
```bash
# a=preserve links, n=dry run, v=verbose
$ rsync -anv --exclude '.git/' . username@remote_host:/root/directory
# remove the `n` to run for real
```

#### 2FA Gmail
If you have 2FA enabled on your gmail account. You will need to use an application specific password in the `gmailPassword` field. Follow the steps [here](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en-GB).

#### Fetching data from the API
For testing, fetch api data with curl. The repo should already include tests and accompanying json documents, so this shouldn't really be necessary
```sh
$ curl "https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/nodes" -o t0.json
```
